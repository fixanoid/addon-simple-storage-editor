Simple Storage Editor
=====================
Simple Storage Editor is a Firefox add-on to view and edit [Firefox Add-on SDK simple storage]
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/modules/sdk/simple-storage.html).


What does it do?
----------------
SSE lists currently installed add-ons that use simple storage and allows the user to edit the contents of the storage.


Why?
----
Firefox provides a convenient way to edit preferences through about:config, but no way
to edit simple storage created by add-ons. Having quick access to simple storage would be especially useful for 
mobile testing and development.
